# Technical-Blogs
Technical blogs that I write as part of my journey to becoming a skilled Full Stack Developer!

I recently learned about the importance of writing blogs through a cohort I follow (ChaiCode). As part of this journey, documenting everything helps me:
<br>
âœ… Quickly revisit topics for revision
<br>
âœ… Gain a deeper understanding of concepts
<br>
âœ… Improve my technical writing skills, which will be valuable in my professional career
