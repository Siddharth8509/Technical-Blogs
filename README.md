# Technical-Blogs
Technical Blogs that I write through my journey to become a good Full Stack Developer !
I recently got to know about the importance of writing blogs through a cohort that I am following (ChaiCode) where it's important for us to document everything . It really helps us to Jump right back 
to the place we want to revise and also it helps us really understand the topic inside out and also polishes our Technical Blog writing skill which will also help in our proffesional life!
